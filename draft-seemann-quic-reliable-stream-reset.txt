                      Reliable QUIC Stream Resets
            draft-seemann-quic-reliable-stream-reset-latest

Abstract

   QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a RESET_STREAM frame to reset a stream.
   When a sender resets a stream, it stops retransmitting STREAM frames
   for this stream.  On the receiver side, there is no guarantee that
   any of the data sent on that stream is delivered to the application.
   This document defines a new QUIC frame, the RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM
   frame, that resets a stream, while guaranteeing reliable delivery of
   stream data up to a certain byte offset.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC v1 ([RFC9000]) allows streams to be reset.  When a stream is
   reset, the sender doesn't retransmit stream data for the respective
   stream.  On the receiver side, the QUIC stack is free to surface the
   stream reset to the application immediately, even if it has already
   received stream data for that stream.

   Applications running on top of QUIC might need to send an identifier
   at the beginning of the stream in order to associate that stream with
   a specific subpart of the application.  For example, WebTransport
   ([WEBTRANSPORT]) uses a variable-length-encoded integer (as defined
   in QUIC v1) to transmit the ID of the WebTransport session to the
   receiver.

   It is desirable that the receiver is able to associate incoming
   streams with their respective subpart of the application, even if the
   QUIC stream is reset before the identifier at the beginning of the
   stream was read.

   This document describes a QUIC extension defining a new frame type,
   the RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame.  This frame allows an endpoint to
   mark a portion at the beginning of the stream which will then be
   guaranteed to be delivered to receiver's application, even if the
   stream was reset.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Negotiating Extension Use

   Endpoints advertise their support of the extension described in this
   document by sending the reliable_reset_stream (0x727273) transport
   parameter (Section 7.4 of [RFC9000]) with an empty value.  An
   implementation that understands this transport parameter MUST treat
   the receipt of a non-empty value as a connection error of type
   TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.

   In order to allow reliable stream resets in 0-RTT packets, the client
   MUST remember the value of this transport parameter.  If 0-RTT data
   is accepted by the server, the server MUST not disable this extension
   on the resumed connection.

4.  RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM Frame

   Conceptually, the RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame is a RESET_STREAM frame
   with an added Reliable Size field.

   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x72,
     Stream ID (i),
     Application Protocol Error Code (i),
     Final Size (i),
     Reliable Size (i),
   }

   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frames contain the following fields:

   Stream ID: A variable-length integer encoding of the stream ID of the
   stream being terminated.

   Application Protocol Error Code: A variable-length integer containing
   the application protocol error code (see Section 20.2) that indicates
   why the stream is being closed.

   Final Size: A variable-length integer indicating the final size of
   the stream by the RESET_STREAM sender, in units of bytes; see
   (Section 4.5 of [RFC9000]).

   Reliable Size: A variable-length integer indicating the amount of
   data that needs to be delivered to the application before the error
   code can be surfaced, in units of bytes.

   If the Reliable Size is larger than the Final Size, the receiver MUST
   close the connection with a connection error of type
   FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

   Semantically, a RESET_STREAM frame is equivalent to a
   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame with the Reliable Size set to 0.

   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frames are ack-eliciting.  When lost, they MUST
   be retransmitted, unless a RESET_STREAM frame or another
   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame was sent for the same stream (see
   Section 5.1).

5.  Resetting Streams

   When resetting a stream, the node has the choice between using a
   RESET_STREAM frame and a RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame.  When using a
   RESET_STREAM frame, the behavior is unchanged from the behavior
   described in ([RFC9000]).

   The initiator MUST guarantee reliable delivery of stream data of at
   least Reliable Size bytes.  If STREAM frames containing data up to
   that byte offset are lost, the initiator MUST retransmit this data,
   as described in (Section 13.3 of [RFC9000]).  Data sent beyond that
   byte offset SHOULD NOT be retransmitted.

   A receiver that delivers stream data to the application as an ordered
   byte stream MUST deliver all bytes up to the Reliable Size before
   surfacing the stream reset error.  As described in (Section 3.2 of
   [RFC9000]), it MAY deliver data beyond that offset to the
   application.

5.1.  Multiple RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM / RESET_STREAM frames

   The initiator MAY send multiple RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frames for the
   same stream in order to reduce the Reliable Size.  It MAY also send a
   RESET_STREAM frame, which is equivalent to sending a
   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame with a Reliable Size of 0.

   When sending multiple frames for the same stream, the initiator MUST
   NOT increase the Reliable Size.  When receiving a
   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame with a lower Reliable Size, the receiver
   only needs to deliver data up the lower Reliable Size to the
   application before surfacing the stream reset error.  It MUST NOT
   expect the delivery of any data beyond that byte offset.

   Reordering of packets might lead to a RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame
   with a higher Reliable Size being received after a
   RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame with a lower Reliable Size.  The receiver
   MUST ignore any RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame that increases the
   Reliable Size.

   When sending another RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM frame for
   the same stream, the initiator MUST NOT change the Application Error
   Code or the Final Size.  If the receiver detects a change in those
   fields, it MUST close the connection with a connection error of type
   STREAM_STATE_ERROR.
